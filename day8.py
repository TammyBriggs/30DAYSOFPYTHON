# 1. Write a Python program to find all the unique combinations of 3 numbers from a given list of numbers, adding up to a target number.
# 2. Write a Python program to return a new set with unique items from both sets by removing duplicates. Given: set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70} Expected output: {70, 40, 10, 50, 20, 60, 30}
# 3. Update the first set with items that donâ€™t exist in the second set Given two Python sets, write a Python program to update the first set with items that exist only in the first set and not in the second set. Given: set1 = {10, 20, 30} set2 = {20, 40, 50} Expected output: set1 {10, 30}
